# Basic understanding of Chinese language
Chinese language is easy to begin with. There are many discrete characters, each having some meaning. There is no explicit tense or voice. They are implied by the meaning. Chinese is not hard to understand once you understand each individual character. It's better to learn individual characters first, before you get familiar with how they form sentences.

Sometimes you need to know internet memes... Don't worry. Many Chinese don't understand those memes either.
